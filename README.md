> ByteStream is a file sharing webapp where you can share files with your friends.

## General
> ByteStream uses some security measures to ensure account safety.
> 1. JWT tokens are used for Authorisation, authentication and session management.
> 2. User passwords are being hashed and salted to ensure things like Rainbow tables are ineffective at cracking passwords.
> 3. Encryption during file transfer to protect the file data from eavesdropping, man in the middle (MITM) attacks or tempering while it transits.
